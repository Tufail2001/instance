--crewai create flow blog_flow (creates a folder of blog_flow)

@LangGraph, create a simple example of implementing this router design pattern using the functional API. Use a  random module to route
Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized follow-up task. This workflow allows for the separation of concerns
and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs
