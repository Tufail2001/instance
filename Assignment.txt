--crewai create flow blog_flow (creates a folder of blog_flow)

@LangGraph create a simple example to implement this router design pattern using fanctional api. Use  random modeule to route
Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for seperation of concerns,
and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs
